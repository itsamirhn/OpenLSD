# This is the lab configuration file, as provided by the course
# template. This is file intended to configure settings about your
# OS and your kernel, such as the lab number and the list of
# available bonuses.
#
# This file is submitted to Themis, so make sure that you do not
# change any "nonstandard" settings here.
#
# Any settings related to your specific environment should go to
# the other configuration file, env.mk.

# This is the current lab number. It will be updated in the
# template for every next lab, so don't change it yourself.
LAB=5

# This variable can be used to specify the set of bonus features
# you have implemented in your kernel. This is used when running
# "make test-all" or when submitting to Themis. Each of the bonus
# features will be tested separately, in isolation, to prevent
# interference between bonus features.
#BONUSES = FOO BAR FOOBAR

# The following setup can be used to specify custom configuration
# settings for specific bonus features. For example, for the SMEP/
# SMAP bonus in lab 3, this setup can be used to selectively
# enable the proper QEMU runtime flags.
#
# In this setup, the following variables can be modified:
## QEMUOPTS - For additional QEMU parameters.
## CFLAGS   - For additional compilation parameters
# Make sure to use "+=" to not override any other settings.
#
# ifneq ($(filter FOO,$(BONUS)),)
# QEMUOPTS += ...
# endif

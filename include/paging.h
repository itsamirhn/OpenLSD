 * Page descriptor structures, mapped at USER_PAGES.
 * Read/write to the kernel, read-only to user programs.
 *
 * Each struct page_info stores metadata for one physical page
 * (frame). It is NOT the physical page itself, but there is a
 * one-to-one correspondence between physical pages and struct
 * page_infos. You can map a struct page_info * to the
 * corresponding physical address with page2pa() in kernel/mem.h.
 *
 * While this metadata struct is heavily used by the buddy
 * allocator, the struct is meant to represent actual physical
 * page state. In particular, we maintain the following "rules":
 *
 * - If either pp_ref > 0 or pp_free == 1, then the page is
 *   managed by the buddy allocator.
 * - For static memory (e.g. video memory) that should not be
 *   managed by the buddy allocator, ensure that pp_ref == 0 and
 *   pp_free == 0.
 * - Any pages that can be written to by the kernel should be
 *   marked as available. In other words: it should be forbidden
 *   to write to a page that is not available.
